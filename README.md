# Lightning Collaborative

## Installation (Development Only)

Requires npm/node & yarn to be installed to create the build. We'll eventually ship the build once it's ready.

```
cd lightning-collaborative/ui/
yarn build
```

Make sure to install [lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/lightning#installing-the-latest-release).

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
lightning run app app.py
```
